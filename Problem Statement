Problem Statement
Title: "Improving Medical Question Pair Similarity Detection using DistilBERT and Transformers"
Objective:

To develop a machine learning model capable of determining the similarity between pairs of medical questions. This project aims to enhance the accuracy of identifying duplicate questions or semantically similar questions in medical forums, thereby improving user experience and information retrieval.
Background:

Medical forums and Q&A platforms often face the challenge of duplicate or similar questions being asked by different users. Identifying these pairs can help in merging duplicates and providing more comprehensive answers. Traditional methods of text similarity often fail to capture the nuanced language of medical questions. Using advanced transformer models like DistilBERT can significantly improve the performance of such tasks.
Dataset:

The "medical_questions_pairs" dataset from Hugging Face consists of pairs of medical questions and labels indicating whether they are duplicates or not.
Methodology:

    Data Preprocessing:
        Load and preprocess the medical question pairs dataset.
        Tokenize the questions using the DistilBERT tokenizer.
        Prepare the data for input to the DistilBERT model.

    Model Development:
        Fine-tune a DistilBERT model on the medical question pairs dataset.
        Use a classification head to determine the similarity between question pairs.

    Model Training and Evaluation:
        Train the model on the training dataset.
        Validate the model using the validation dataset to avoid overfitting.
        Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

    Deployment:
        Deploy the trained model to a web application for real-time similarity detection of medical question pairs.
        Provide a user-friendly interface for inputting question pairs and displaying similarity results.
