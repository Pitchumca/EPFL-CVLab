Objective:

To develop a deep learning model capable of identifying defects in medical implants using the OpenMaterial dataset. The project aims to improve the accuracy and efficiency of detecting defective materials in medical implants, thereby ensuring higher quality standards in medical devices.
Background:

Defective medical implants can lead to severe complications, including device failure and adverse patient outcomes. Traditional methods of defect detection are often time-consuming and prone to human error. By leveraging deep learning techniques, we can automate the defect detection process, enhancing accuracy and reliability.
Dataset:

The OpenMaterial dataset from EPFL-CVLab contains images of various materials with different types of defects. For this project, we will focus on images of medical implants and classify them as defective or non-defective.
Methodology:

    Data Preprocessing:
        Load and preprocess images from the OpenMaterial dataset.
        Normalize and resize images for uniformity.
        Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.

    Model Development:
        Utilize a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture suitable for image classification.
        Experiment with pre-trained models such as VGG19 or ResNet50 to leverage transfer learning.
        Fine-tune the model on the medical implant images to detect defects.

    Model Training and Evaluation:
        Train the model on the training dataset.
        Validate the model using the validation dataset to avoid overfitting.
        Evaluate the model's performance on the test dataset using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

    Deployment:
        Deploy the trained model to a web application for real-time defect detection in medical implants.
        Provide a user-friendly interface for uploading images and displaying results.
